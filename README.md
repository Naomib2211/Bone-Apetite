## Design

![Color Theme](documentation/adobeColor-My-Color-Theme.pdf)

- These colors were customized on Adobe color.
- This combination of colors were used to create a warm and inviting first impression, but also feeling overall.
- The different tones and shades of brown gives an earthy and natural vibe.
- Another reason for using this combination of colors was to bring forth the color of cookies, where a "classic" cookie has different shades of brown and beige to present the cookie dough and chocolate pieces.

![Playfair](documentation/playfair.pdf)

- Used for the logo title of the cafe name.
- It was chosen to show a classic and stylish look, in contrast to the cute and warm overall feeling of the website and the cafe's message.
- Contrast to the other text sections of the website, in order to highlight the name of the cafe, making it more memorable.

![Raleway](documentation/raleway.pdf)

- Used for all the parts containing text except for the logo title. 
- Less "harsh" than the logo title, to give a softer look together with the color theme. 
- Goes along well with the message in each body of text in the main-section, to push forward the message of a warm welcome.
