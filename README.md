## Design

[Color Theme](documentation/adobeColor-My-Color-Theme.pdf)

- These colors were customized on Adobe color.
- This combination of colors were used to create a warm and inviting first impression, but also feeling overall.
- The different tones and shades of brown gives an earthy and natural vibe.
- Another reason for using this combination of colors was to bring forth the color of cookies, where a "classic" cookie has different shades of brown and beige to present the cookie dough and chocolate pieces.

[Playfair](documentation/playfair.pdf)

- Used for the logo title of the cafe name.
- It was chosen to show a classic and stylish look, in contrast to the cute and warm overall feeling of the website and the cafe's message.
- Contrast to the other text sections of the website, in order to highlight the name of the cafe, making it more memorable.

[Raleway](documentation/raleway.pdf)

- Used for all the parts containing text except for the logo title. 
- Less "harsh" than the logo title, to give a softer look together with the color theme. 
- Goes along well with the message in each body of text in the main-section, to push forward the message of a warm welcome.

### Bugs
+ ##### Solved bugs
    1. Logo title had an underline that would not go away.
        Solution: Targeted the logo title in CSS and added it with property and value of "text-decoration: none;".

    ---
+ ##### Unsolved bugs

    - None

+ ##### Mistakes

    - Throughout this project, there were some mistakes in how changes were commited. 
        * Commited in past tense
        * Commit messages were too long
        * Unnecessary commits
    - Learned through much practice to write commits in present tense, simpler descriptions to keep it short and waited until greater changes were made to commit changes. 

    - Accidental additions of unknown files
        * Being new to coding and programming technology caused these errors. In the future, this will be corrected and modified.

+ ### Accessibility and performance 

    ![Performance score Home Page](documentation/lighthouse_performance_score.png)
    ![Performance score Gallery Page](documentation/lighthouse_performance_gallery.png)
    ![Performance score Contact Page](documentation/lighthouse_performance_contact.png)
    ![Responsepage](documentation/lighthouse_performance_response.png)

    - Using Lighthouse in dev tools, the performance score was set. Everything is 100% except for in the "performance" section on all pages, including the response page.
        * This is because of the images of the page. Not re-sizing the images before adding to page, caused this performance score.
